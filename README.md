# Dice Rolling App

Welcome to my first Flutter app! This simple application allows you to roll a virtual dice and get a random number between 1 and 6. As a beginner in Flutter development, I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## How to Use

1. **Install Flutter**: If you haven't already, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```git clone https://github.com/shivank76/dice_app.git```


3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

    ```cd dice_app```

4. **Run the App**: Connect your device or start an emulator, then run the app using the following command:

    ```flutter run```

5. **Roll the Dice**: Once the app is running on your device, simply tap on the "Roll dice" button and get a random number between 1 and 6.
